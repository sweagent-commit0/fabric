class Connection(Context):
    """
    A connection to an SSH daemon, with methods for commands and file transfer.

    **Basics**

    This class inherits from Invoke's `~invoke.context.Context`, as it is a
    context within which commands, tasks etc can operate. It also encapsulates
    a Paramiko `~paramiko.client.SSHClient` instance, performing useful high
    level operations with that `~paramiko.client.SSHClient` and
    `~paramiko.channel.Channel` instances generated from it.

    .. _connect_kwargs:

    .. note::
        Many SSH specific options -- such as specifying private keys and
        passphrases, timeouts, disabling SSH agents, etc -- are handled
        directly by Paramiko and should be specified via the
        :ref:`connect_kwargs argument <connect_kwargs-arg>` of the constructor.

    **Lifecycle**

    `.Connection` has a basic "`create <__init__>`, `connect/open <open>`, `do
    work <run>`, `disconnect/close <close>`" lifecycle:

    - `Instantiation <__init__>` imprints the object with its connection
      parameters (but does **not** actually initiate the network connection).

        - An alternate constructor exists for users :ref:`upgrading piecemeal
          from Fabric 1 <from-v1>`: `from_v1`

    - Methods like `run`, `get` etc automatically trigger a call to
      `open` if the connection is not active; users may of course call `open`
      manually if desired.
    - It's best to explicitly close your connections when done using them. This
      can be accomplished by manually calling `close`, or by using the object
      as a contextmanager::

          with Connection('host') as c:
             c.run('command')
             c.put('file')

      .. warning::
          While Fabric (and Paramiko) attempt to register connections for
          automatic garbage collection, it's not currently safe to rely on that
          feature, as it can lead to end-of-process hangs and similar behavior.

    .. note::
        This class rebinds `invoke.context.Context.run` to `.local` so both
        remote and local command execution can coexist.

    **Configuration**

    Most `.Connection` parameters honor :doc:`Invoke-style configuration
    </concepts/configuration>` as well as any applicable :ref:`SSH config file
    directives <connection-ssh-config>`. For example, to end up with a
    connection to ``admin@myhost``, one could:

    - Use any built-in config mechanism, such as ``/etc/fabric.yml``,
      ``~/.fabric.json``, collection-driven configuration, env vars, etc,
      stating ``user: admin`` (or ``{"user": "admin"}``, depending on config
      format.) Then ``Connection('myhost')`` would implicitly have a ``user``
      of ``admin``.
    - Use an SSH config file containing ``User admin`` within any applicable
      ``Host`` header (``Host myhost``, ``Host *``, etc.) Again,
      ``Connection('myhost')`` will default to an ``admin`` user.
    - Leverage host-parameter shorthand (described in `.Config.__init__`), i.e.
      ``Connection('admin@myhost')``.
    - Give the parameter directly: ``Connection('myhost', user='admin')``.

    The same applies to agent forwarding, gateways, and so forth.

        Set up a new object representing a server connection.

        :param str host:
            the hostname (or IP address) of this connection.

            May include shorthand for the ``user`` and/or ``port`` parameters,
            of the form ``user@host``, ``host:port``, or ``user@host:port``.

            .. note::
                Due to ambiguity, IPv6 host addresses are incompatible with the
                ``host:port`` shorthand (though ``user@host`` will still work
                OK). In other words, the presence of >1 ``:`` character will
                prevent any attempt to derive a shorthand port number; use the
                explicit ``port`` parameter instead.

            .. note::
                If ``host`` matches a ``Host`` clause in loaded SSH config
                data, and that ``Host`` clause contains a ``Hostname``
                directive, the resulting `.Connection` object will behave as if
                ``host`` is equal to that ``Hostname`` value.

                In all cases, the original value of ``host`` is preserved as
                the ``original_host`` attribute.

                Thus, given SSH config like so::

                    Host myalias
                        Hostname realhostname

                a call like ``Connection(host='myalias')`` will result in an
                object whose ``host`` attribute is ``realhostname``, and whose
                ``original_host`` attribute is ``myalias``.

        :param str user:
            the login user for the remote connection. Defaults to
            ``config.user``.

        :param int port:
            the remote port. Defaults to ``config.port``.

        :param config:
            configuration settings to use when executing methods on this
            `.Connection` (e.g. default SSH port and so forth).

            Should be a `.Config` or an `invoke.config.Config`
            (which will be turned into a `.Config`).

            Default is an anonymous `.Config` object.

        :param gateway:
            An object to use as a proxy or gateway for this connection.

            This parameter accepts one of the following:

            - another `.Connection` (for a ``ProxyJump`` style gateway);
            - a shell command string (for a ``ProxyCommand`` style style
              gateway).

            Default: ``None``, meaning no gatewaying will occur (unless
            otherwise configured; if one wants to override a configured gateway
            at runtime, specify ``gateway=False``.)

            .. seealso:: :ref:`ssh-gateways`

        :param bool forward_agent:
            Whether to enable SSH agent forwarding.

            Default: ``config.forward_agent``.

        :param int connect_timeout:
            Connection timeout, in seconds.

            Default: ``config.timeouts.connect``.


        :param dict connect_kwargs:

            .. _connect_kwargs-arg:

            Keyword arguments handed verbatim to
            `SSHClient.connect <paramiko.client.SSHClient.connect>` (when
            `.open` is called).

            `.Connection` tries not to grow additional settings/kwargs of its
            own unless it is adding value of some kind; thus,
            ``connect_kwargs`` is currently the right place to hand in paramiko
            connection parameters such as ``pkey`` or ``key_filename``. For
            example::

                c = Connection(
                    host="hostname",
                    user="admin",
                    connect_kwargs={
                        "key_filename": "/home/myuser/.ssh/private.key",
                    },
                )

            Default: ``config.connect_kwargs``.

        :param bool inline_ssh_env:
            Whether to send environment variables "inline" as prefixes in front
            of command strings (``export VARNAME=value && mycommand here``;
            this is the default behavior), or submit them through the SSH
            protocol itself.

            In Fabric 2.x this defaulted to ``False`` (try using the protocol
            behavior), but in 3.x it changed to ``True`` due to the simple fact
            that most remote servers are deployed with a restricted
            ``AcceptEnv`` setting, making use of the protocol approach
            non-viable.

            The actual default value is the value of the ``inline_ssh_env``
            :ref:`configuration value <default-values>` (which, as above,
            currently defaults to ``True``).

            .. warning::
                This functionality does **not** currently perform any shell
                escaping on your behalf! Be careful when using nontrivial
                values, and note that you can put in your own quoting,
                backslashing etc if desired.

                Consider using a different approach (such as actual
                remote shell scripts) if you run into too many issues here.

            .. note::
                When serializing into prefixed ``FOO=bar`` format, we apply the
                builtin `sorted` function to the env dictionary's keys, to
                remove what would otherwise be ambiguous/arbitrary ordering.

            .. note::
                This setting has no bearing on *local* shell commands; it only
                affects remote commands, and thus, methods like `.run` and
                `.sudo`.

        :raises ValueError:

        what remote shell to invoke, or are connecting to a non-POSIX-server
        environment such as a network appliance or other custom SSH server.
        Nearly every other use case, including interactively-focused ones, will
        be better served by using `run` plus an explicit remote shell command
        (eg ``bash``).

        `shell` has the following differences in behavior from `run`:

        - It still returns a `~invoke.runners.Result` instance, but the object
          will have a less useful set of attributes than with `run` or `local`:

            - ``command`` will be ``None``, as there is no such input argument.
            - ``stdout`` will contain a full record of the session, including
              all interactive input, as that is echoed back to the user. This
              can be useful for logging but is much less so for doing
              programmatic things after the method returns.
            - ``stderr`` will always be empty (same as `run` when
              ``pty==True``).
            - ``pty`` will always be True (because one was automatically used).
            - ``exited`` and similar attributes will only reflect the overall
              session, which may vary by shell or appliance but often has no
              useful relationship with the internally executed commands' exit
              codes.

        - This method behaves as if ``warn`` is set to ``True``: even if the
          remote shell exits uncleanly, no exception will be raised.
        - A pty is always allocated remotely, as with ``pty=True`` under `run`.
        - The ``inline_env`` setting is ignored, as there is no default shell
          command to add the parameters to (and no guarantee the remote end
          even is a shell!)

        It supports **only** the following kwargs, which behave identically to
        their counterparts in `run` unless otherwise stated:
