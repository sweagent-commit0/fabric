    A collection of `.Connection` objects whose API operates on its contents.

    .. warning::
        **This is a partially abstract class**; you need to use one of its
        concrete subclasses (such as `.SerialGroup` or `.ThreadingGroup`) or
        you'll get ``NotImplementedError`` on most of the methods.

    Most methods in this class wrap those of `.Connection` and will accept the
    same arguments; however their return values and exception-raising behavior
    differ:

    - Return values are dict-like objects (`.GroupResult`) mapping
      `.Connection` objects to the return value for the respective connections:
      `.Group.run` returns a map of `.Connection` to `.runners.Result`,
      `.Group.get` returns a map of `.Connection` to `.transfer.Result`, etc.
    - If any connections encountered exceptions, a `.GroupException` is raised,
      which is a thin wrapper around what would otherwise have been the
      `.GroupResult` returned; within that wrapped `.GroupResult`, the
      excepting connections map to the exception that was raised, in place of a
      ``Result`` (as no ``Result`` was obtained.) Any non-excepting connections
      will have a ``Result`` value, as normal.

    For example, when no exceptions occur, a session might look like this::

        >>> group = SerialGroup('host1', 'host2')
        >>> group.run("this is fine")
        {
            <Connection host='host1'>: <Result cmd='this is fine' exited=0>,
            <Connection host='host2'>: <Result cmd='this is fine' exited=0>,
        }

    With exceptions (anywhere from 1 to "all of them"), it looks like so; note
    the different exception classes, e.g. `~invoke.exceptions.UnexpectedExit`
    for a completed session whose command exited poorly, versus
    `socket.gaierror` for a host that had DNS problems::

        >>> group = SerialGroup('host1', 'host2', 'notahost')
        >>> group.run("will it blend?")
        {
            <Connection host='host1'>: <Result cmd='will it blend?' exited=0>,
            <Connection host='host2'>: <UnexpectedExit: cmd='...' exited=1>,
            <Connection host='notahost'>: gaierror(...),
        }

    As with `.Connection`, `.Group` objects may be used as context managers,
    which will automatically `.close` the object on block exit.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0
    .. versionchanged:: 2.4
        Added context manager behavior.

        constructors.

        Any keyword arguments given will be forwarded directly to those
        `.Connection` constructors as well. For example, to get a serially
        executing group object that connects to ``admin@host1``,
        ``admin@host2`` and ``admin@host3``, and forwards your SSH agent too::

            group = SerialGroup(

            This method changes some behaviors over e.g. directly calling
            `.Connection.get` on a ``for`` loop of connections; the biggest is
            that the implied default value for the ``local`` parameter is
            ``"{host}/"``, which triggers use of local path parameterization
            based on each connection's target hostname.

            Thus, unless you override ``local`` yourself, a copy of the
            downloaded file will be stored in (relative) directories named
            after each host in the group.

        .. warning::
            Using file-like objects as the ``local`` argument is not currently
            supported, as it would be equivalent to supplying that same object
            to a series of individual ``get()`` calls.
