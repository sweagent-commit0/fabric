    Auth strategy that tries very hard to act like the OpenSSH client.

    .. warning::
        As of version 3.1, this class is **EXPERIMENTAL** and **incomplete**.
        It works best with passphraseless (eg ssh-agent) private key auth for
        now and will grow more features in future releases.

    For example, it accepts a `~paramiko.config.SSHConfig` and uses any
    relevant ``IdentityFile`` directives from that object, along with keys from
    your home directory and any local SSH agent. Keys specified at runtime are
    tried last, just as with ``ssh -i /path/to/key`` (this is one departure
    from the legacy/off-spec auth behavior observed in older Paramiko and
    Fabric versions).

    We explicitly do not document the full details here, because the point is
    to match the documented/observed behavior of OpenSSH. Please see the `ssh
    <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh>`_ and `ssh_config
    <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config>`_ man pages for more information.
