    Thread subclass for tunnelling connections over SSH between two endpoints.

    Specifically, one instance of this class is sufficient to sit around
    forwarding any number of individual connections made to one end of the
    tunnel or the other. If you need to forward connections between more than
    one set of ports, you'll end up instantiating multiple TunnelManagers.

    Wraps a `~paramiko.transport.Transport`, which should already be connected
    to the remote server.
