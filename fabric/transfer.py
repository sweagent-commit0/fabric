        Copy a file from wrapped connection's host to the local filesystem.

        :param str remote:
            Remote file to download.

            May be absolute, or relative to the remote working directory.

            .. note::
                Most SFTP servers set the remote working directory to the
                connecting user's home directory, and (unlike most shells) do
                *not* expand tildes (``~``).

                For example, instead of saying ``get("~/tmp/archive.tgz")``,
                say ``get("tmp/archive.tgz")``.

        :param local:
            Local path to store downloaded file in, or a file-like object.

            **If None or another 'falsey'/empty value is given** (the default),
            the remote file is downloaded to the current working directory (as
            seen by `os.getcwd`) using its remote filename. (This is equivalent
            to giving ``"{basename}"``; see the below subsection on
            interpolation.)

            **If a string is given**, it should be a path to a local directory
            or file and is subject to similar behavior as that seen by common
            Unix utilities or OpenSSH's ``sftp`` or ``scp`` tools.

            For example, if the local path is a directory, the remote path's
            base filename will be added onto it (so ``get('foo/bar/file.txt',
            '/tmp/')`` would result in creation or overwriting of
            ``/tmp/file.txt``).

            This path will be **interpolated** with some useful parameters,
            using `str.format`:

            - The `.Connection` object's ``host``, ``user`` and ``port``
              attributes.
            - The ``basename`` and ``dirname`` of the ``remote`` path, as
              derived by `os.path` (specifically, its ``posixpath`` flavor, so
              that the resulting values are useful on remote POSIX-compatible
              SFTP servers even if the local client is Windows).
            - Thus, for example, ``"/some/path/{user}@{host}/{basename}"`` will
              yield different local paths depending on the properties of both
              the connection and the remote path.

            .. note::
                If nonexistent directories are present in this path (including
                the final path component, if it ends in `os.sep`) they will be
                created automatically using `os.makedirs`.

            **If a file-like object is given**, the contents of the remote file
            are simply written into it.

        :param bool preserve_mode:
            Whether to `os.chmod` the local file so it matches the remote
            file's mode (default: ``True``).

        :returns: A `.Result` object.

        :param local:
            Local path of file to upload, or a file-like object.

            **If a string is given**, it should be a path to a local (regular)
            file (not a directory).

            .. note::
                When dealing with nonexistent file paths, normal Python file
                handling concerns come into play - for example, trying to
                upload a nonexistent ``local`` path will typically result in an
                `OSError`.

            **If a file-like object is given**, its contents are written to the
            remote file path.

                In addition, this means that 'falsey'/empty values (such as the
                default value, ``None``) are allowed and result in uploading to
                the remote home directory.

            .. note::
                When ``local`` is a file-like object, ``remote`` is required
                and must refer to a valid file path (not a directory).
